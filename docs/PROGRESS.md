## Verification commands
- `npm test`: vitest unit tests (stealth state machines, rect utilities, timetable)
- `npm run build`: type-check plus production build
- In `npm run dev`, from the browser console:
  - `await __game.checkRoutes()`: player routes, vaults/drops, nav connectivity, runner chases
  - `__dev.start('story' | 'arcade')`, `__dev.tp(x, y, z)`, `__dev.god()`, `__dev.noGuards()`, `__dev.record(fn)`

## Next
All planned phases are done. Still needed: a human playtest (mouse feel, pointer lock, music by ear).
