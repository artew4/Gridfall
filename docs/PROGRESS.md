# NEON RAIN 3.0 — progress log

Branch `feature/cinematic-escape` (baseline tag `v2.0`). No remote push.

## Done
| Phase | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | (with 1) | plan in `docs/PLAN-3.0.md`, vitest added |
| 1 | 66e3e5b | holster (H), Perception/AlertSystem (unit-tested), Guard FSM, Security (radio, reinforcements, gunshots), story HUD |
| 2 | e9ae8d2 | instanced civilians: witnesses + reports, panic/recovery; DEV `window.__dev` helpers |
| 3a | 8afb8b7 | rooftop layer (8.5 m), bridges, stairs S5–S8, vaulting, nav walkability + goal-rooted routing |
| 3b | cdc04c8 | Sakura Line station (−6 m), three entrances with lockdown shutters |
| 4 | 511ef22 | timetable (tested), metro train with interior, boarding, ending + end card |
| 5 | f260638 | Mission: 4 acts, ambush/relay/station set pieces, checkpoints, director sweeps; main menu (Story/Arcade/Settings/Controls); story intro |
| 6 | 8035b71 | layered adaptive score (replaces 3-song backend), minimap (seen/heard only), rear-threat arcs |
| 7 | 4b4fa6e | enemy rigs merged per joint and material (guard 36 → 22 meshes), dead code removed, README, lifecycle checks |

## Verification commands
- `npm test`: vitest unit tests (stealth state machines, rect utilities, timetable)
- `npm run build`: type-check plus production build
- In `npm run dev`, from the browser console:
  - `await __game.checkRoutes()`: player routes, vaults/drops, nav connectivity, runner chases
  - `__dev.start('story' | 'arcade')`, `__dev.tp(x, y, z)`, `__dev.god()`, `__dev.noGuards()`, `__dev.record(fn)`

## 3.1: stealth and pursuit overhaul
Branch `feature/stealth-pursuit-overhaul`, baseline tag `v3.0`. Plan and root causes: `docs/PLAN-3.1.md`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kenji fix | 2446ff8 | one interaction controller; talk step; first line shown at once |
| Phase 2 | ba81bf5 | 3D perception, shared VISION config, ground plane blocks upward rays, guard knowledge split |
| Phase 3 | 0a5e238 | last-known-position pursuit, radio range, search roles, finite response, unreachable goals |
| Phase 4 | b920e68 | minimap view cones (wall-clipped, floor-aware, same maths as the guards) |
| Phase 6 | de36bfa | tuning: engaged guards look up |
| Phase 7 | (this) | relay alarm limited to 4 units within radio range, docs, QA |

## Next
Still needed: a human playtest of detection fairness, minimap readability, pursuit feel, mouse and shooting.
