## 3.4: multi-setting architecture and Desert Outpost
Branch `feature/multi-setting-3.4`, based on 3.3 (`5db9d7f`). Architecture: `docs/LEVELS.md`. Performance: `docs/BENCH-3.4.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## 3.5: desert polish, setting entities, quit to menu
Branch `feature/desert-polish-3.5`, based on 3.4 (`90ce917`).

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| Phase 3 | 17a5c12 | clutter and cover, organic dunes, transition, detail map, brush |
| Phase 4 | (this commit) | validation, docs |

## 3.6: Deep Jungle, pump shotgun, guerrilla hunters
Branch `feature/jungle-setting-3.6`, based on 3.5 (`d9dac12`). Architecture notes: `docs/LEVELS.md`. Performance: `docs/BENCH-3.6.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 3 | 8e92c83 | multi-pellet hitscan, pump cycle, tube reload (engine, setting-agnostic); BOAR shotgun; jungle hunters; shotgun and jungle audio |
| Phases 1, 2, 4 | 82152e2 | Deep Jungle: registration, temple, forest, foliage, mist, dappled sun, nav (includes the fixes from validation: log bank, stair cheeks, nav lanes, light-cookie leak) |
| Phase 5 | (this commit) | validation results, benchmark, docs |

Validation (Chrome, Apple M5, `npm run dev`):
- **World and stress:**
  - `world()`: 0 findings; 63,728 reachable cells, every zone reached;
  - `stress` (3000 samples × 8 directions × 5 rate profiles × walk and sprint-jump): 0 of 240,000 runs failed.
  - Before the fixes it caught a pocket beside a climbable log and a pinch on a stair cheek.
- **Level AI:**
  - `levelAI` at sight 25: runners 315/315, gunners 21/21, graph connected;
  - at sight 300: 314/315, then 315/315 on a second run. The one stall was a runner on the shrine's outside corner (intermittent).
- **Quit to menu:** 5 jungle rounds (waves, shotgun fired, reload). GPU geometries 87, textures 36, programs 56, DOM 214, level audio 10, scene children 57 and InstancedMeshes 9 are flat after the cookie fix (textures had grown by 1 per round).
- **Cross-setting:** jungle → desert → Tokyo → jungle → desert. Each setting keeps its own weapon, enemy look, ambience, fog and engine hooks (spawn distance, sight range, static shadows restored for Tokyo). Single-shot damage is unchanged (Kitsune 33–35, Jackal 20–22).
- **Bench (Balanced):** jungle 60 FPS in all 6 scenarios, GPU 5.7–6.4 ms, 53–92 draw calls. The desert (4.4–5.3 ms) and Tokyo (6.3–6.6 ms) match 3.5.
- **Tests and build:** 74 unit tests pass; the production build has no dev tools.

## 3.7: Deep Jungle military base (assault layout)
Branch `feature/jungle-base-3.7`, based on 3.6 (`2ac5aa3`). Architecture notes: `docs/LEVELS.md` (Assault-ready layout). Performance: `docs/BENCH-3.7.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phases 1–3 | e06589d | Firebase Viper (`Base.ts` replaces `Ruins.ts`), terrain pad, strip and road, hybrid cover, foliage and mist rework, paramilitary guards, barracks and jungle spawns (`minSpawnDistance(spawn)`, `pickSpawn`); includes the fixes from validation |
| Phase 4 | (this commit) | validation results, benchmark, docs |

Validation (Chrome, Apple M5, `npm run dev`):
- **World and stress:**
  - `world()`: 0 findings; 62,896 reachable cells, all 12 zones reached (barracks, comms center and roof, watchtower, gate, motor pool, depot, helipad, yard, perimeter, road, forest);
  - `stress({samples: 7500})`: 0 of 240,000 runs; `stress({samples: 3000, fps: ['spiky', 30]})`: 0 of 96,000.
  - Before the fix it caught one run: a sprint-jump landing in the corner of a 0.5 m rubble slab at the breach (vault rule), now plain solid.
- **Pinch scan** (every cylinder against every solid box and cylinder, gaps 0.05–0.75 m): found a drum 0.55 m from a cabinet and cliff-foot rocks 0.13–0.73 m from neighbouring rock-wall boxes (fixed; the generator came from 3.6). Remaining: none, except a false positive (non-adjacent drums in a touching row). Closest tree to the wall: 7.35 m.
- **Doorways** (the real controller, aimed steering, 5 lateral offsets × 2 distances × walk and sprint, both directions): barracks S1, S2, E; comms W; gate; postern; breach all 20/20 each way. Comms S 20/20 in. Outward it was 0/20 (stopped against the blast wall, the test's target), which exposed a nav node inside the HESCO: the wall was moved to leave a 2 m lane.
- **Level AI** (`levelAI({spawns: 31})`, 31 spawns × 18 goals): runners 558/558 and gunners 31/31, at sight 50 and at sight 300, four runs. Before the fix, runners stalled 20–54 s (one timeout) on the comms stair: re-planning from mid-stair picked the bottom node. Now the worst stall is ~10 s (a detour round the east wall to the gate or postern).
- **Quit to menu:** 5 rounds with audio running (waves started each round). Geometries 146, textures 52, programs 57, DOM 228, level audio 10, scene children 93 and InstancedMeshes 10, all flat.
- **Cross-setting:** jungle → desert → Tokyo → jungle → desert. Each keeps its own weapon, enemy look (`guards`/`mercs`/`neon`), ambience, fog, title and hooks; `pickSpawn` is only set in the jungle; Tokyo's shadow auto-update is restored.
- **Bench (Balanced):** jungle 60 FPS in all 6 scenarios, GPU 6.07–6.35 ms, CPU 1.9–2.3 ms, 65–129 draw calls, ~374k triangles (3.6: 324k). Same session: the desert takes 5.6–6.0 ms and Tokyo 6.5–6.7 ms.
- **Tests and build:** 75 unit tests pass; the production build has no dev tools.

## 4.0: visual overhaul, vertical slice on Tokyo (Lantern Street, the plaza)
Branch `feature/visual-overhaul-tokyo-4.0`, based on 3.7 (`37566b6`). Numbers: `docs/BENCH-4.0.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phases 1–3 | d59e6ba | bloom and grade retune, F8 comparison, wet model, reflection catchers, street AO, interleaved bench |
| Phases 4–5 | (this commit) | validation results, benchmark, docs |

**Already in place before 4.0** (not rebuilt):
- `EffectComposer` with RenderPass (world), a viewmodel pass, UnrealBloom, a grade pass and OutputPass;
- ACES filmic tone mapping;
- a DOM HUD;
- shader wet ground with puddles, ripples and additive neon streaks.

4.0 retuned and extended these.

Validation (Chrome, Apple M5, `npm run dev`, Balanced applied in memory; saved settings unchanged):
- **Bloom threshold from data:** HDR buffer, 480×270, emissives off. Lit surfaces above 1.0: ≤ 0.012% of pixels in four of five views. The fifth has a pre-existing sign-light hot spot (0.11%, unchanged with the 4.0 additions off). With everything on, the plaza goes from 1.57% above 0.92 to 0.75% above 1.0: dim window emissives stop blooming, neon (2.6–55) doesn't.
- **Reflection catchers:** real `PointLight`s first. They cost +2.1 ms GPU in the metro (none visible there) and +0.8 ms at the plaza, and at the sign's height they changed 0.07% of a frame. Moved into the wet shader (specular only, widened lobe, ≤ 2.2 m): 3.9% of a Lantern Street frame at intensity 5, cost within noise. Point lights stay at 15, as in 3.7.
- **Component cost** (GPU ms, mean of 2, interleaved):

  | View | 4.0 | 3.7 | raw | 4.0 without catchers | 4.0 without AO |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Lantern St | 6.18 | 5.78 | 5.82 | 6.45 | 5.61 |
  | Plaza | 6.09 | 5.87 | 5.53 | 5.67 | 5.77 |
  | Metro | 5.32 | 5.16 | 4.53 | 5.16 | 5.15 |

- **Bench, 8 scenarios × 3 pipelines, interleaved, all valid:**
  - GPU: 4.0 4.76–5.99 ms, raw 4.23–5.70 ms, 3.7 4.96–5.91 ms;
  - CPU 4.1–6.9 ms;
  - draw calls 4.0 151–448, raw 139–392.
- **60 FPS: NOT VERIFIED in this session.** The laptop was on battery at 18–20%, and Chrome capped `requestAnimationFrame` at ~31 Hz (Energy Saver) in every pipeline, 3.7 included. Frame cost (GPU ≤ 6 ms, CPU ≤ 7 ms) is far inside 16.7 ms. Re-run `__dev.bench(3, { pipelines: ['v4', 'raw', 'v37'] })` plugged in.
- **World:** `world()` 0 findings and 14,486 reachable cells (as 3.3); `stress({samples: 2000})` 0 of 64,000; the `colliders()` overlay matches. No collider changed.
- **Quit to menu (Tokyo, 5 rounds with a wave):** geometries 268, textures 112, programs 126, DOM 247, all flat (the AO texture is freed through `userData`).
- **Cross-setting:** the desert and jungle keep their 3.7 bloom and grade (split 0).
- **Tests and build:** 75 unit tests pass; the production bundle has no dev code (`__dev`, F8).

## 4.1: High preset fix, Desert visual overhaul
Branch `feature/visual-overhaul-desert-4.1`, based on 4.0 (`284308f`). Numbers: `docs/BENCH-4.1.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | a3fe3fa | High preset: frame-rate-independent flicker (`heldNoise`), three bloom levels for every preset |
| Phases 2–3 | 85499d7 | desert: sun ×1.6, bleach bypass and amber grade, data-picked bloom threshold, sun glare, dust glints, glossy metals, heat haze in the grade pass |
| Phases 4–5 | (this commit) | validation, benchmark, docs |

**The High bug, root causes** (High is the only preset with a 120 FPS cap and five bloom levels):
1. **Light flicker drew `Math.random()` once per frame:** sign modes `flicker` and `broken`, the train's arcs and window dips, the lightning flicker and the fountain rings. At 120 FPS signs toggled twice as often (flicker 3.12 → 6.42 jumps/s, broken 1.22 → 2.72; simulated with the real function). Each sign's light, halo, streak and 4.0 puddle catcher strobed with it.
2. **Five bloom levels at Tokyo's 4.0 radius (0.9):**
   - they laid a full-screen haze (+11% mean luminance on a frozen frame; pixel ratio alone changed nothing) from 1/32 and 1/64 buffers that pumped with the strobing signs;
   - they cost 8.4–9.4 ms GPU against 5.2–5.9 ms with three, over the 8.3 ms of a 120 FPS frame.

**Not the cause** (checked): the pixel ratio (no point sprites, bloom sized from CSS pixels), the adaptive resolution (stayed at 1.5 for 24 s at 111–120 FPS), the muzzle and viewmodel flashes (already time-based).

After the fix, a frozen frame on High vs Balanced has mean luminance 62.0 vs 61.7.

Validation (Chrome, Apple M5, charging, rAF 123 Hz; presets applied in memory, saved settings unchanged):
- **Desert bench, Balanced, 4.1 / raw / 3.7 interleaved, all valid:**
  - 4.1 holds 59.6–60.3 FPS in all 6 scenarios (clear and storm);
  - GPU: 4.1 5.4–5.9 ms, 3.7 5.3–5.7 ms (within noise), raw 3.7–4.6 ms.
- **Tokyo:**
  - High (fixed): 112–116 FPS at 2184×1423, GPU 4.3–5.1 ms, P95 14–16 ms;
  - Balanced: 59.9–60 FPS in all 8 scenarios (the check 4.0 couldn't make on battery), GPU 6.1–6.4 ms.
- **Heat haze cost:** a separate full-screen ShaderPass measured +3.5 ms GPU at a 60 cap and +2.5 ms at 120 (a plain copy pass cost the same; the extra pass, not the maths). Folded into the grade pass's existing fetches: within noise (on 5.4 vs off 5.8 ms). Verified to touch only the band just below the horizon (pixel diff by row), not the gun or the sky.
- **Desert bloom threshold from HDR data** (clear, 4 headings, plus a 32-heading sweep):
  - sunlit sand median 0.26, max 0.55–0.72;
  - sky up to ~0.6;
  - metal glints up to 2.0;
  - the sun disc 30.
  - Threshold 1.0.
- **Teardown, Tokyo → Desert → Menu → Tokyo, 4 rounds:**
  - every render parameter identical on every Tokyo arrival and every desert arrival (exposure, bloom, all grade uniforms, haze, wet model, fog, shadows);
  - a deterministic frozen frame differs after a desert round by as much as Tokyo differs from itself after a plain rebuild (2.3% vs 2.2–2.5% of pixels: per-load randomness in Tokyo's world build);
  - the jungle keeps its 3.7 grade.
- **Memory:** desert quit-to-menu flat over 5 rounds (106 geometries, 43 textures, 45 programs, 246 DOM); Tokyo flat from round 1.
- **Collisions (desert):** the `colliders()` overlay matches; `world()` 0 findings, 123,810 reachable cells, 10 zones; `stress({samples: 3000})` 0 of 96,000.
- **Tests and build:** 78 unit tests pass (2 new: flicker rate, preset bloom levels); no dev code in the bundle.

## 4.2: Jungle visual overhaul ("Oppressive jungle")
Branch `feature/visual-overhaul-jungle-4.2`, based on 4.1 (`74e3c37`). Numbers: `docs/BENCH-4.2.json`.

| Step | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phases 1–3 | 2a1ee68 | grade (shadow hue, crush, bleach, yellow-green highlights), FogExp2 #485a46 / 0.03, wet mud, wet leaves, five geometric light shafts |
| Phases 4–5 | (this commit) | validation, benchmark, docs |

**Look, by data:** the jungle's linear HDR is dim (scene median 0.03–0.1, p95 0.11–0.26; only bulbs exceed 1). So the grade ranges were set to: darks end at 0.07, highlight push 0.08–0.4. Bloom threshold stays 0.95: the shafts add at most 0.21 and don't bloom; they are a soft glow by construction.

**Light shafts:**
- five open cones from 34 m down to the ground, aimed from the sun's own position;
- additive, depthWrite off, edge falloff `|n·v|^2.2`, faded in from the canopy and near the camera, taken away by the fog (not blended toward it);
- each lands on a fleck painted into the sun cookie, so the ground under it is lit.

**Validation** (Chrome, Apple M5, charging; Balanced applied in memory, saved settings unchanged):
- **Bench, 4.2 / 3.7 / raw interleaved, 6 scenarios, all valid:**
  - 4.2 holds 59.6–60.3 FPS;
  - GPU: 4.2 5.8–6.4 ms, 3.7 5.3–6.2 ms, raw 4.8–5.4 ms;
  - draw calls +1 to +5 (the shafts in view).
- **Shafts alone:**
  - yard +0.1 ms;
  - worst case +0.5 ms (standing at a shaft's foot looking up it, 4 in view), still 60 FPS;
  - watchtower within noise.
- **Mud alone** (ground materials recompiled without the patch): within noise (on ≤ off in both views).
- **High** (in memory): 111–113 FPS at 2184×1423, GPU 4.1–4.3 ms.
- **Teardown, Tokyo → Desert → Jungle → Menu, 3 rounds:**
  - one render state per setting across rounds (exposure, bloom, every grade uniform, fog colour and density, background, env intensity, sight range);
  - the shafts only exist in the jungle;
  - textures 111/40/53 every round.
- **Collisions:**
  - `world()`: 0 findings;
  - `stress({samples: 3000})`: 0 of 96,000;
  - 539 colliders, none at any shaft foot;
  - `resolveCircle` doesn't move a body at a shaft, and rays through and down the shafts hit only the ground or walls beyond.
- **Tests and build:** 81 unit tests pass (3 new: shafts can't be raycast, are soft and depth-free, and lean to the sun); no dev code in the bundle.

**Gameplay note:** the thicker fog shortens the enemies' sight in the jungle from 49 m to 43 m (it has always been tied to the fog).

## Next
Human playtest:
- 4.2 items: is the jungle oppressive or just dark? Are the shafts cinematic or too strong up close? Does the mud read as wet in motion? Is the fog too thick for spotting enemies?
- 4.1 items: is High now steady, the desert's harshness (too bleached?), the sun glare and glints, the heat haze in motion (too subtle or too much?), storms with the new grade.
- 4.0 items: does the teal/orange read as cinematic or as a filter, is the bloom too tight now, do the puddle reflections and the street AO read in motion, F8 side by side; and the frame rate with the charger in.
- 3.7 items: does the road pull you to the gate, is the cleared strip a fair kill zone, do defenders out of the barracks feel like a garrison, are the guards readable in the mist, the doorways and stairs by feel, the watchtower and comms roof as positions.
- 3.6 items: the shotgun's feel (kick, pump timing, the boom), whether 8 m one-shot range feels right, hunters' readability in the undergrowth and mist, the climbable logs, the dappled light, the jungle soundscape.
- 3.5 items: the rifle's feel (recoil, rate, sound), whether the mercenaries read well at a distance and in the storm, the clutter as cover, quitting to the menu and starting again.
Earlier items:
- 3.4 items: the setting menu, the desert in calm and in the storm (can you hear them coming?), the buildings' doors and stairs, whether the storm feels fair, and the performance on your machine.
Earlier items:
- 3.2 items: does the machine run cooler, is the story clear, do the objectives and markers help, is X comfortable, does the ending land;
- 3.3 items: jumping inside the train and riding it, boarding at an angle, standing in a doorway as the doors close, the rooftop edges and the fence, the metro stairs (look and feel), and any wall that seems invisible (note the coordinates from `__game.debug()`).
